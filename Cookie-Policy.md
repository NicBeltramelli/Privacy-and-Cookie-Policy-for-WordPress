Our [Privacy Policy](YOUR-PRIVACY-POLICY-URL) explains our principles when it comes to the collection, processing, and storage of your information. This policy specifically explains how we and our partners deploy cookies, as well as the options you have to control them.

### What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to "remember" you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a "session cookie") or for multiple repeat visits (using a "persistent cookie"). They ensure a consistent and efficient experience for visitors, and perform essential functions such as allowing users to register and remain logged in. Cookies may be set by the site that you are visiting (known as "first party cookies"), or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website ("third party cookies"). Both websites and HTML emails may also contain other tracking technologies such as "web beacons" or "pixels." These are typically small transparent images that provide us with statistics, for similar purposes as cookies. They are often used in conjunction with cookies, though they are not stored on your computer in the same way. As a result, if you disable cookies, web beacons may still load, but their functionality will be restricted.

### **How We Use Cookies**

We use cookies for a number of different purposes. Some cookies are necessary for technical reasons; some enable a personalized experience for both visitors and registered users; and some allow the display of advertising from selected third party networks. Some of these cookies may be set when a page is loaded, or when a visitor takes a particular action (clicking the "like" or "follow" button on a post, for example). Many of the cookies we use are only set if you are a registered YOUR-COMPANY-WEBSITE user (so you don’t have to log in every time, for example), while others are set whenever you visit one of our websites, irrespective of whether you have an account. For more information on the choices you have about the cookies we use, please see the Controlling Cookies section below.

### **Types of Cookies**

The table below explains the types of cookies we use on our websites and why we use them.

|Category of cookies|Why we use these cookies|
|---|---|
|Strictly Necessary|These cookies are essential for websites on our services to perform their basic functions. These include those required to allow registered users to authenticate and perform account related functions, as well as to save the contents of virtual "carts" on sites that have an ecommerce functionality.|
|Functionality|These cookies are used to store preferences set by users such as account name, language, and location.|
|Security|We use these cookies to help identify and prevent potential security risks.|
|Analytics and Performance|Performance cookies collect information on how users interact with our websites, including what pages are visited most, as well as other analytical data. We use these details to improve how our websites function and to understand how users interact with them.|

As a result, cookies may be set by these third parties, and used by them to track your online activity. We have no direct control over the information that is collected by these cookies.|

#### **Cookies from Third Parties**

We operate in partnership with third party vendors. Third Parties cookies enable us and our partners to offer services and to personalize them based on user's information.

### Controlling Cookies

Visitors may wish to restrict the use of cookies or completely prevent them from being set. Most browsers provide for ways to control cookie behavior such as the length of time they are stored – either through built-in functionality or by utilizing third party plugins. If you disable cookies, please be aware that some of the features of our service may not function correctly. To find out more on how to manage and delete cookies, visit aboutcookies.org. For more details on your choices regarding use of your web browsing activity for interest-based advertising visit [youronlinechoices.eu](http://youronlinechoices.eu) (EU based) or [optout.aboutads.info](http://optout.aboutads.info) (US based). On a mobile device, you may also be to adjust your settings to limit ad tracking.   You can opt out of Google Analytics by installing [Google’s opt-out browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

### Consent for Cookies

You may see a “cookie banner” on our websites, particularly if you are in the European Union. If so, then we do not allow our partners to set cookies before you accept, except for those exempt from the consent requirement and therefore not subject to preventive blocking (strictly necessary technical cookies and statistical anonymized cookies). When you consent, we and our partners may set third party cookies in order to, for example, provide more engaging advertising to users, remember the most recent searches or interactions, or improve campaign performance reports.
