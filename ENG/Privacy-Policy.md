### Information We Collect

We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so (for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better). We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.

#### _Information You Provide to Us_

It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:

*   **Basic Account Information:** We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your YOUR-COMPANY-WEBSITE account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for an account to provide a username and email address–and that’s it. You may provide us with more information (like your name) but we don’t require that information to create an account.
*   **Public Profile Information:** If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile. For example, if you have an account, your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, such as a photo or an “About Me” description. Your public profile information is just that–public–so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.
*   **Transaction and Billing Information:** If you buy something from us (a subscription to a specific plan, or a physical or digital product). For example, you will provide additional personal and payment information that is required to process the transaction and your payment, such as your name, credit card information, and contact information.
*   **Content Information:** Depending on the Services you use, you may also provide us with information about you in draft and published content. For example, if you write a blog post that includes biographic information about you, we will have that information, and so will anyone with access to the Internet if you choose to publish the post publicly. This might be obvious to you…but it’s not to everyone!
*   **Communications With Us (Hi There!):** You may also provide us information when you respond to surveys or communicate with our Happiness Engineers about a support question.

#### _Information We Collect Automatically_

We also collect some information automatically:

*   **Log Information:** Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services (for example, when you create or make changes to your account).
*   **Usage Information:** We collect information about your usage of our Services (e.g. page views), along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better.
*   **Location Information:** We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.
*   **Information from Cookies & Other Technologies:** A cookie is a small string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. YOUR-COMPANY-NAME uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads. For more information about our use of cookies and other technologies for tracking, including how you can control the use of cookies, please see our [Cookie Policy](YOUR-COOKIE-POLICY-URL).

#### _Information We Collect from Other Sources_

We may also get information about you from other sources. For example, if you create or log into your account through another service (like Google) or if you connect your account to a social media service (like Twitter or Facebook), we will receive information from that service (such as your username, basic profile information, and friends list) via the authorization procedures used by that service. The information we receive depends on which services you authorize and any options that are available. We may also get information, such as a mailing address, from third party services about individuals who are not yet our users (…but we hope will be!), which we may use, for example, for marketing and advertising purposes like postcards and other mailers advertising our services.

### How And Why We Process Personal Data

#### _Purposes for Process Personal Data_

We use information about you as mentioned above and for the purposes listed below:

*   To provide our Services (for example, to set up and maintain your account or charge you for any of our paid Services).
*   To further develop and improve our Services.
*   To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use.
*   To measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising, and better understand user retention and attrition (for example, we may analyze how many individuals purchased a plan after receiving a marketing message or the features used by those who continue to use our Services after a certain length of time).
*   To monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, protect the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of YOUR-COMPANY-NAME and others, which may result in us declining a transaction or the use of our Services.
*   To communicate with you (for example through an email, about offers and promotions offered by YOUR-COMPANY-NAME and others we think will be of interest to you), solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date on YOUR-COMPANY-NAME and our products.
*   To personalize your experience using our Services, target our marketing messages to groups of our users (for example, those who have a particular plan with us or have been our user for a certain length of time), and serve relevant advertisements.

### Sharing Information

#### _How We Share Information_

We do not sell our users’ private personal information. We only work with Processing partners who are able to ensure adequate level of protection to your Personal Data. We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:

*   **Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors:** We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.
*   **Third Party Vendors:** We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you, our hosting provider, those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g. by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns), those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers), who may need information about you in order to, for example, provide technical or other support services to you. We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them. Other vendors are listed in our more specific policies (e.g. our [Cookie Policy](YOUR-COOKIE-POLICY-URL)).
*   **Legal Obligation:** We may disclose information about you in response to a governmental request when we are legally obliged to do so, or if there are other legal grounds for it.
*   **To Protect Rights, Property, and Others:** We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of YOUR-COMPANY-NAME, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury.
*   **Business Transfers:** In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that YOUR-COMPANY-NAME goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.
*   **With Your Consent:** We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do so, such as the social media services that you connect to your personal account through our social login feature.
*   **Aggregated or De-Identified Information:** We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services and we may share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.
*   **Published Support Requests:** And if you send us a request (for example, via a support email or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.

#### _Information Shared Publicly_

Information that you choose to make public is–you guessed it–disclosed publicly. That means, of course, that information like your public profile, bio or other content that you make public on our website, and your “Likes” and comments, are all available to others. For example, the photo that you upload to your public profile.
Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share.

#### _Information Shared Outside EEA_

The information about you that we process when you use the Services in the EU may be used, stored, and/or accessed by individuals operating outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who work for us, other members of our group of companies, or third party data processors. This is required for the purposes listed in the How and Why We Process Personal Data section above. When providing information about you to entities outside the EEA, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy as required by applicable law. These measures include:

*   In the case of US based entities, entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with them, or ensuring they have signed up to the [EU-US Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome); or
*   In the case of entities based in other countries outside the EEA, entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with them.

### How Long We Keep Information

We generally discard information about you when we no longer need the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it (which are described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information) and we are not legally required to continue to keep it. For example, we keep the web server logs that record information about a visitor to our website, such as the visitor’s IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days. We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to our website and investigate issues if something goes wrong on our website. As another example, when you delete a post, page, or comment from our sites, it stays in your Trash folder for thirty days just in case you change your mind and would like restore that content (because starting again from scratch is no fun, at all). After the thirty days are up, the deleted content may remain on our encrypted backups and caches until purged.

### Security

While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so. We use safe protocols for communication and transferring data (such as HTTPS). We use anonymising and pseudonymising where suitable. We monitor our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks. We implement a robust encrypted backup strategy.


### Choices

You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:

*   **Limit the Information that You Provide:** If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services may not be accessible.
*   **Opt-Out of Electronic Communications:** You may opt out of receiving promotional messages from us. Just follow the instructions in those messages. If you opt out of promotional messages, we may still send you other messages, like those about your account and legal notices.
*   **Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies**.
*   **Export your Data or Delete your Account and Data:** If you no longer want to use our Services, you can close your account and delete your data. Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Information above (for example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply with or demonstrate our compliance with legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.
